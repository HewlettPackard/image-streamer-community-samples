# Plan Script Type: deploy

# Plan Script Description:
# Configure hostname and populate the network directory with ifcfg-* files and 
# /etc/hosts. NOTE: This script MUST be executed after the 
# Linux-configure-multiple-NICs-Deploy Plan Script. NOTE: The hostname is 
# associated to the IP address of the first discovered NIC, which is shell 
# variable iface=${array[0]}) NOTE: Not suitable for XenServer
