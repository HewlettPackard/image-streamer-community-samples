# Plan Script Type: deploy

# Plan Script Description:
# Validate the Golden Image/OS-Volume against invalid captures and prepare the RC 
# file to be modified by the deployment Plan Scripts. When needed, copy the 
# bootloader in the EFI/BOOT directory of the UEFI partition. Tested with 
# CentOS-1810, XenServer 7.6 and Ubuntu 19.04. Should work fine with SLE 15
