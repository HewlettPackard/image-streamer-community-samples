# Plan Script Type: deploy

# Plan Script Description:
# Configure all the NICs corresponding to the Connections defined in the OneView 
# Profile. The number of NICs to configure corresponds to the number of connected 
# NICs defined in the Server Profile. Restrictions: With this version, it is not 
# possible to configure less NICs than connections present in the Profile. 
# Moreover, the NICs to configure must be in sequence. For example It is not 
# possible to configure NIC1 and NIC3 and not NIC2. NOTE: For a maximum of 
# flexibility, when this Plan Script is included in a Build Plan, make sure, for 
# each NIC, you edit its Build Plan's Custom Attributes and select all the 
# offered possibilities: "Allow static", "Allow DHCP", "Allow no network 
# connection". NOTE: Not suitable for XenServer.
